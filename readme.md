# PROJECT 2: Hospi-pals

This project aims to create a place for younger people going through hospital treatment to come together, chat, meet-up, and provide support to one another.

## APPROACH

### Ruby + Ruby on Rails

I began this project by focussing on creating a working database with correct logic and links between tables using ruby and ruby on rails. The database comprises of seven tables describing users and the groups to which they belong, along with linking tables and information tables.

A diagram of the tables is available [here]: https://github.com/zchryst/hospi-pals/blob/master/views/index.xml

### HTML AND CSS

After ensuring the tables were all working together correctly I created the actual web pages. The movement between pages was facilitated using ruby along with the creation of a lot of the elements.

Once all the views were functioning correctly I styled them using HTML and CSS.

## CHALLENGES

One of my biggest challenges was coming up with a good name - I still have not done so . . .

Remembering to make commits frequently, particularly after each module of work.

About halfway through I got absolutely bogged down in not actually really knowing where I was going with things, I kind of had something in my head about making something like meet-ups crossed with something a bit like slack and . . . still not really sure where I was going.
-- this may indicate more planning would have been good

Super difficult to plan out the tables, particularly as I started making the app and realising that this feature would be necessary - then that feature, etc. it's very tempting to go and put them in and not stick to the MVP

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

*Add more ability to control groups as an admin
*Improve styling of the entire things
*Create ability to edit profile and group
*Create chat with individual users
*Just a whole lot more things
